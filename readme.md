Simple Weather App.

## Description

This is a simple weather app that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any given location. By entering a city name or geographic location, users can retrieve essential weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon that visually represents the current weather. The app fetches this data from a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and dynamically displays the information in a user-friendly interface. It is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle API requests and update the UI with the latest weather details. This app offers an intuitive and efficient way to stay informed about the weather, making it a great project for practicing API integration and frontend development skills.
